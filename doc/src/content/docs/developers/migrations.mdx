description: This document explains how to create and manage database migrations in Atomic CRM.

While customizing the CRM, you will probably need to update the database schema. You can do this using [Supabase migrations](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/supabase-migration-new).

## Creating Migrations Locally

You can create a new migration locally using the following command:

```sh
npx supabase migration new <migration_name>
```

This will create a new migration file in the `supabase/migrations` directory. You can then update this file with the necessary changes to the database schema.

Then, apply the migrations locally using the following command:

```sh
npx supabase migration up
```

When you are ready to apply the migrations to the remote Supabase instance, push the migrations using the following command:

```sh
npx supabase db push
```

## Alternative: Creating Migrations Remotely

You can also change the schema using the Supabase Dashboard.

When it's done, generate a new migration file based on the new schema using the following command:

```sh
npx supabase db diff | npx supabase migration new <migration_name>
```

Then, apply the migrations locally using the following command:

```sh
npx supabase migration up
```

## Updating The Import Feature

From the frontend UI, users can import contacts and companies via a csv file.

If you change the data structure for a contact, don't forget to modify the sample CSV file located at [`src/components/atomic-crm/contacts/contacts_export.csv`](https://github.com/marmelab/atomic-crm/blob/main/src/components/atomic-crm/contacts/contacts_export.csv). You'll also need to modify the import function found in [`src/components/atomic-crm/contacts/useContactImport.tsx`](https://github.com/marmelab/atomic-crm/blob/main/src/components/atomic-crm/contacts/useContactImport.tsx).
