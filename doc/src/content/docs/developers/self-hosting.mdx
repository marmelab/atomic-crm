description: This document explains how to host Atomic CRM and Supabase yourself.
---

In order to facilitate self-hosting Atomic CRM with Supabase, we provide a few Make commands.

First, initialize the docker setup by running:

```sh
make docker-init
```

This command will ask you to allow writing an `./docker/.env` file for Supabase. When it's done, feel free to customize this file. Refer to the [Supabase documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker#configuring-and-securing-supabase) for details about each variable.

## Development

Once this is done, you can run the following command to start the development environment:

```sh
make docker-start
```

To setup the database and edge functions required by Atomic CRM migrations, run the following command, replacing the `[POOLER_TENANT_ID]` and `[POSTGRES_PASSWORD]` placeholders with the values from the Supabase `./docker/.env` file:

```sh
PGSSLMODE=disable npx supabase db push --db-url "postgres://postgres.[POOLER_TENANT_ID]:[POSTGRES_PASSWORD]@[your-domain]:5432/postgres"
```

`PGSSLMODE=disable` is required to access the local postgres instance.

Finally, update the frontend application `.env` file to target the local supabase instance:

```sh
FRONTEND_HTTP_HOST=true
FRONTEND_HTTP_PORT=3000
FRONTEND_HMR_PORT=3001
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=Put the ANON_KEY value from ./docker/.env
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=Put the SERVICE_ROLE_KEY value from ./docker/.env
```

Replace the port of the `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` variable with the one you choose for `SUPABASE_PUBLIC_URL` in the Supabase `./docker/.env` file.
