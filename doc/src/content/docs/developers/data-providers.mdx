title: Data Providers
description: This document explains the data providers used in the development of Atomic CRM.
---

By default, the Atomic CRM uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com) for the backend API. Supabase is an open-source alternative to Firebase, built on top of Postgres. It provides a REST API and a real-time subscription system. The generous free tier allows you to run a small CRM for free.

## Using Test Data

Developing features with an empty database can be challenging. To help with this, Atomic CRM includes a CSV file with test data that can be imported into the application.

To import the test data, follow these steps:

1. Go to the contacts page.
2. Click the "Import" button.
3. Select the file located at `test-data/contacts.csv`.

## Using A Fake API For Development

For development purposes, you can use an alternative data provider called [FakeRest](https://github.com/marmelab/FakeRest). It's a simple REST API running in the browser that resets the data on each page reload. It's useful for testing the frontend without having to set up a backend, e.g. to let end users test some updates before the backend is ready.

### Running The App With FakeRest

Type the following command to start the application with the FakeRest data provider:

```bash
npm run dev:demo
```

This will start the application on [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) using FakeRest as the data provider. You will be logged in as a demo user with admin rights.

:::tip
FakeRest is used in the [Atomic CRM demo](https://marmelab.com/atomic-crm-demo/), where you can test it live.

### Setting Up The FakeRest Data Provider

If you want to set up the FakeRest data provider manually, you need to change the `dataProvider` import in the `src/App.tsx` file:

```diff
// in App.tsx
import { CRM } from "@/atomic-crm/root/CRM";
+import { authProvider, dataProvider } from "@/atomic-crm/providers/fakerest";

const App = () => (
-    <CRM />
+    <CRM dataProvider={dataProvider} authProvider={authProvider} />
);

export default App;

```

**Warning**: As supabase is still the default data provider, its environment variables (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) are **still required**.

### Filters Syntax

The list filters used in this project MUST follow the [`ra-data-postgrest`](https://github.com/raphiniert-com/ra-data-postgrest) convention, where the filter operator is concatenated to the field name with an `@`. For example, to filter contacts by first name, you would use the `first_name@eq` filter.

When using FakeRest, the filters are mapped at runtime to the FakeRest filter syntax by the the [`supabaseAdapter`](../../src/providers/fakerest/internal/supabaseAdapter.ts) file. If a filter is not yet supported by the adapter, you have to modify this file to add support for it.
