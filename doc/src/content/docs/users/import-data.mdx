Whether you are starting to use Atomic CRM, or want to migrate from another CRM, you can import your contacts, companies, tasks, notes, tags and deals in a few clicks. You can also export your contacts and companies in CSV format, and your contacts as vCard files.

## Import Contacts From CSV

Atomic CRM displays an import contact buttons in the initial user onboarding page, and in the contacts page. When clicking on it, a modal is displayed to upload a CSV file.

An example of the expected CSV file is available in the contact import modal:

```csv
first_name,last_name,gender,title,background,first_seen,last_seen,has_newsletter,status,tags,linkedin_url,company,email_work,email_home,email_other,phone_work,phone_home,phone_other

```

When importing contacts, companies and tags will be automatically matched if they exist on the system, or imported otherwise.

## Export Contacts To CSV

In the contacts and companies pages, an export button allows to download the list of contacts or companies in CSV format.

## Migrating From Another CRM

Atomic CRM allows to import contacts, companies, tasks, notes, tags and deals from a single JSON file. You can create this JSON file from the export of your previous CRM. The expected format of the JSON file looks like the following:

```json
{
  "sales": [
    { "id": 123, "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Doe", "email": "john@acme.com" }
  ],
  "companies": [
    { "id": 234, "name": "A company" },
    { "id": 345, "name": "Another company", "description": "A description", "city": "A city", "country": "A country", "address": "An address", "zipcode": "A zipcode", "state_abbr": "A state abbreviation", "sales_id": 123 }
  ],
  "contacts": [
    { "id": 456, "first_name": "Jane", "last_name": "Smith" },
    { "id": 567, "first_name": "A first name", "last_name": "A last name", "title": "A title", "company_id": 345, "background": "A background", "linkedin_url": "A URL", "sales_id": 123, "emails": [ { "email": "nickname@domain.com", "type": "Work" } ], "phones": { "number": "45646746788", "type": "Home" }, "tags": ["MyTag"] }
  ],
  "notes": [
    { "contact_id": 456, "sales_id": 123, "text": "Some text", "date": "2025-11-13T08:16:10Z" },
    { "contact_id": 456, "sales_id": 123, "text": "Some long text with lines\n\nAnother line", "date": "2025-02-14T09:20:21Z", "attachments": [ { "url": "https://mycurrentcrm.com/files/link", "name": "important.pdf" } ] }
  ],
  "tasks": [
    { "contact_id": 456, "sales_id": 123, "text": "A task title" },
    { "contact_id": 456, "sales_id": 123, "text": "Another task title", "due_date": "2025-03-26T16:15:00Z", "done_date": "2025-04-01T09:00:00" }
  ],
}

```
