Durable Atomic CRM knowledge. One sentence per bullet, freshest first. Maintained by the `documentator` agent — see [.claude/agents/documentator.md](.claude/agents/documentator.md).

## Business Knowledge

- Core resources: contacts, companies, deals (Kanban pipeline), tasks, notes, tags, and sales (team members).
- Domain options (genders, sectors, deal stages/categories, note statuses, task types) are `<CRM>` props in `src/App.tsx`, not hardcoded.
- Sales users sync with Supabase `auth.users` via triggers; deletion is unsupported — accounts are disabled instead.
- Aggregated reads use database views (`contacts_summary`, `companies_summary`), which FakeRest emulates in the frontend.
- Two interchangeable data providers: Supabase (production) and FakeRest (in-browser demo, resets on reload).
- Filters use `ra-data-postgrest` syntax (`field_name@operator`); operators must be supported by the FakeRest `supabaseAdapter`.
